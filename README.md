## Customization

### Changing the Bus Route
To track a different bus route, update these values in `script.js`:
```javascript
this.routeId = 'M104';        // Change to your desired route
this.stopId = '401041';       // Change to your desired stop ID
this.direction = 'N';         // 'N' for Northbound, 'S' for Southbound
```

### Styling
The app uses CSS custom properties and modern design patterns. You can customize colors, fonts, and layout by editing `styles.css`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Unable to fetch bus times" error:**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Ensure the MTA API is accessible

2. **No buses showing:**
   - The bus might not be running at this time
   - Check if there are service changes
   - Verify the stop ID is correct

3. **CORS errors:**
   - The MTA API may have CORS restrictions
   - Consider using a backend proxy service
   - Use the mock data for development

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add multiple bus routes
- [ ] Show bus capacity/occupancy
- [ ] Add notifications for approaching buses
- [ ] Include service alerts and delays
- [ ] Add favorite stops functionality
- [ ] Implement offline support

## Security Note

**Important:** Never commit your actual API key to a public repository. The `config.js` file with your real API key is automatically ignored by git. Always use the sample configuration file as a template.

## Demo Mode

This application currently uses mock data for demonstration. For production use with real bus data, you'll need to obtain an MTA API key and configure the application using the setup instructions above.
